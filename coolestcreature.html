    <h1>The coolest creature</h1>

    <p>The <em>panda</em> is awesome because a panda year is equivalent to about three human years in terms of life expectancy. <br> Giant pandas live 18–20 years in the wild and 25 to 30 years in captivity. The world's oldest giant panda was Xinxing (‘New Star') in Chongqing Zoo at 38 years old and four months (1982–2020). That's the equivalent of 115 human years. <br>
        A panda's 6th "finger" is like a human thumb. It has the same function as a thumb, but it is actually an unusual wrist bone or opposable paw heel with strong muscles but no movable joints, which allows it to grasp food. They can press the bamboo into fat cigar shapes with their 6th digits for efficient eating.
        Giant pandas are good tree climbers. They can climb trees from 7 months old. In the wild, giant pandas (particularly cubs) climb trees to avoid their enemies and survey their surroundings. As it is safer in a tree, many giant pandas like to sleep in trees. Sometimes, they just climb to look at the scenery. Giant pandas are bears, and like other bears, they can swim.
