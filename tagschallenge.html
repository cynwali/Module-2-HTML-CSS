        Nobody’s born smart. <strong>We all start at 0.</strong> Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra.<br>
        Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. <em>Nobody’s</em>  good at anything at first.<br>
        There was a time when Einstein couldn’t count to 10.<br>
        And Shakespeare had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.<br>
        Thankfully, we are born to learn.<br>
        <em>Slowly. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.</em> <br>
        <em>Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.</em> <br>
        <strong><em>Until one day, you walk.</em> </strong> <br>
        One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
        Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger.<br>
        Failing is just another word for growing. And you keep going.<br>
        <strong><em>This. is. learning.</em> </strong> <br>
        It’s <em>not</em>  that you <em>don’t </em> get it. <br>
        You just don’t get it, yet.
        Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
        are built on basic ideas that <strong><em>anyone, anywhere</em> </strong>  can understand.<br>
        <strong>Whoever you are, wherever you are.</strong> <br>
